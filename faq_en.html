<summary>Why choose our modular homes?</summary>
<p>
<strong>Каркас of high quality.</strong> Our modular houses
                are built on a frame of planed, dried planks.
                The boards used are 45x95, 45x145, 45x195 mm in size with a
                15-18% moisture content. For maximum strength, the following are used
                reinforced fasteners. The outer part of the framework is
                scaffolding, to which the exterior finish is attached
                selected by the customer. The interior finish can include
                imitation logs, furniture grade plywood or gypsum board. Whole
                wood used for the framing is softwood, in this case
                pine. To ensure long durability and protection
                against harmful agents, the framework is impregnated with a
                preservative, an indelible antiseptic that
                protects the wood from mold, fungi, algae and insects for
                35 years. Exterior visible elements, such as the veranda frame
                and wood trim, are coated with high-quality
                Austrian Adler paints.

<summary>What is a modular home?</summary>
<p>
<strong>Modular house from PANMODUL</strong> - is an innovative
                solution, in which each part of the house is a separate, fully equipped
                fully equipped module. These modules are assembled at the factory and
                delivered to your lot for installation. For example, a module with a
                bathroom already includes a sink, toilet, shower or bathtub,
                boiler, underfloor heating, finishes, and even electrical outlets
                electrical outlets and lighting.

<summary>How is thermal insulation provided?</summary>
<p>
<strong>To ensure a comfortable temperature inside the house</strong>
                And reduce energy consumption for heating and cooling,
                we use high-density rock wool with a thickness of 250 mm in the walls
                and 200 mm in the floor. Inside the house, a vapor barrier is used
                150 microns thick with sealing of all joints for
                full airtightness. The outer layer consists of a membrane
                that protects against moisture, preventing its penetration from the
                outside, while allowing condensation to drain
                from inside the insulation. This ensures a healthy environment and the durability of the
                construction.

<summary>How is the electrical installation done?</summary>
<p>
<strong>In the houses, all electrical installation is hidden in the

                routed inside the walls in flexible, self-extinguishing
                metal-plastic corrugated pipes, which guarantees
                safety and protection of the installation from external influences
                external influences.
                <strong>The material of the wires used in PANMODUL homes is
                  copper.</strong>
                Copper is one of the most effective materials for the installation of
                Electricity, as it is characterized by high electrical conductivity
                electrical conductivity and reliability. The use of copper in
                conductors ensures stable and efficient power supply to all
                electrical appliances and systems in the home.

                foundation before installation, the PANMODUL team will connect the house to the
                external networks during installation. If the installations are not
                brought in, it is necessary to order an additional visit of a specialist

                We live in a cold region. We are afraid that the insulation of
                250 mm will be insufficient. Is it possible to increase it?
              </summary>
<p>
                Our experience shows that if the house has a small area
                (up to 60 m²), additional insulation is usually not
                necessary. Insulating the walls with a thickness of 250 mm and the roof with a thickness of
                300 mm provides very good thermal conductivity indices.
              </p>
</div>
<div class="details">
<summary>How are the floors, walls and roof insulated?</summary>
<p>
                The floors, walls and ceilings in a PANMODUL house are insulated in the same way
                way "all around." Our design excludes air leakage at corners and
                connection points. Joints between modules are filled with board
                Izoplat 12 mm fiber-wood. The modules are then "solidly"
                connected to each other with screws through beams around the perimeter, from floor to
                ceiling.
              </p>
</div>
<div class="details">
<summary>What kind of insulation material is used?</summary>
<p>
                We use IZOVAT insulation. In the composition of the insulating material there are no
                phenol-formaldehyde resins. The insulation has no odor
                chemical, it is made on the basis of natural ingredients,
                safe for the environment and people, fireproof. Recommended for
                use in any climate zone.
              </p>
</div>
<div class="details">
<summary>Will the insulation not shift?</summary>
<p>
                This is impossible because of the design features and technology
                of laying insulation. Since the structure of the house is assembled from
                45×195 wood, in the basic version we use 2
                layers of insulation of 100 mm each. The total thickness of the insulation
                is 200 mm. "Excessive" 5 mm of insulation that extends beyond the
                frame, cause additional friction between the insulation layers and the
                weatherstripping film, and also "stretch" the insulation, pushing the
                it back through the frame and wind protection layer.
                In walls, we use insulation with a high density and stiffness of
                45-50 kg/m³.

<summary>Energy efficiency of windows</summary>
<p>
                The choice of glazing package depends not only on the number of chambers, but
                also on the thickness and additional layers that increase the
                energy efficiency. We use a glazing package
                double-chambered, consisting of three layers of glass. The total
                thickness of the glazing package is 44 mm, which is much higher than the
                standard budget options with a thickness of 32-36 mm. The inner and
                outer layer of glass is covered with a special coating
                energy-saving coating, which prevents heat loss and protects the room from overheating in the
                the room from overheating in the summer. Energy efficiency
                is determined by the heat transfer coefficient Ug = 1.00. In the
                glazing packages that we use in our large facades,
                Ug = 1.00, this is achieved thanks to the metallized coating, which
                reduces the absorption and transmission of thermal radiation
                through the glass and increases the reflectance of the glazing package
                in the range of wavelengths characteristic of thermal radiation
                thermal radiation inside the room.

                Why choose frame houses from PANMODUL?
              </summary>
<p>
                Panmodul company uses modern Prefab technology to build
                frame houses, which ensures high quality, fast
                implementation and reliability of our constructions. Technology
                Prefab (prefabricated) is the process of
                of manufacturing the individual components of a house in a factory and then
                their assembly on the construction site.<br/><br/>
<strong>Design and Planning:</strong><br/>
                At the initial stage, our specialists develop a detailed
                design of the house, which takes into account all the wishes of the client and the
                the specifics of the plot. The design includes accurate drawings and
                specifications of all construction elements.<br/><br/>
<strong>Production at the factory:</strong><br/>
                Once the design is approved, the production of all
                major components of the house, such as walls, ceilings, roof and other
                components. All components are built under controlled conditions
                conditions, which guarantees high quality and compliance with
                standards.<br/><br/>
<strong>Transportation and installation:</strong><br/>

<div class="details">
<summary>How is thermal insulation provided?</summary>
<p>
                To ensure a comfortable temperature inside the house and reduce
                energy consumption for heating and cooling, we use
                high-density rock wool with a thickness of 250 mm in the walls and 250 mm in the
                roof.<br/><br/>

                The double-sided membrane protects against moisture, preventing
                water infiltration from the outside and allowing the drainage of
                condensate from inside the insulation. As a result, the structure remains
                durable, and the house has a healthy microclimate.
              </p>
</div>
<div class="details">
<summary>How is the electrical wiring done?</summary>
<p>
                In houses, all electrical installation is hidden in the structure,
                Which ensures an aesthetically pleasing and neat interior appearance. The wires are
                routed inside the walls in flexible, self-extinguishing
                metal-plastic corrugated tubes, which guarantees
                safety and protection of the wiring from external factors
                external factors.<br/><br/>

                The conductor material used in Panmodul homes is copper. It is
                one of the most effective materials for electrical installations
                electrical systems due to its high conductivity and reliability.
                The use of copper in wiring ensures stable and efficient
                power supply to all electrical devices and systems in the house.

<div class="details">
<summary>What can the facade be like?</summary>
<p>
                When choosing the exterior facade of a frame house, you have
                two main options: ventilated and
                non-ventilated.<br/><br/>
<strong>Ventilated facade:</strong><br/>
                - Materials: wood and metal.<br/>
                - Features: Provides air circulation between the material
                facade material and the wall, which helps remove moisture and prevents
                formation of mold and condensation. This type of facade
                promotes the longevity of the structure and improves the microclimate
                inside the house.<br/><br/>
<strong>Non-ventilated facade:</strong><br/>
                - Materials: mineral wool and facade plaster.<br/>
                - Features: This type of facade seals the walls tightly, providing
                excellent thermal and acoustic insulation. Facade
                unventilated is more often chosen to ensure
                maximum energy efficiency and minimization of heat loss
                heat.<br/><br/>

                The choice between ventilated and non-ventilated facades depends on
                Your preferences and priorities for insulation,
                durability and the exterior appearance of the building.

<summary>What is the heating system?</summary>
<p>
                Frame houses can be equipped with different heating systems,
                each of which has its own advantages and is suitable for different
                conditions and owners' preferences. Here are the main options for systems
                heating systems that can be installed in a frame house:<br/><br/>
<strong>1. electric heating:</strong><br/>
                -<strong>Electric Convectors:</strong> Simple to install,
                No pipe laying required. Ideal for small houses or as
                additional source of heat.<br/>
                -<strong>Infrared heaters:</strong> They heat
                objects and surfaces rather than air, which ensures
                even heat distribution and energy savings.<br/>
                -<strong>Underfloor heating:</strong> Electric
                underfloor heating systems provide comfortable warmth and can be
                used as a main or supplementary heating source.<br/><br/>
<strong>2. gas heating:</strong><br/>
                -<strong>Gas boilers:</strong> A popular and effective option for
                frame houses. Gas boilers can be condensing or
                traditional and can run on natural or liquefied gas.<br/>
                -<strong>Underfloor heating:</strong> Systems
                Water floor heating systems, connected to a gas boiler, provide
                even and comfortable heat.<br/><br/>
<strong>3 Liquid fuel systems:</strong><br/>
                -<strong>Liquid fuel boilers:</strong> They can be used in
                Areas where there is no access to natural gas. These boilers
                operate on diesel or mazut oil and can be integrated with
                radiators or underfloor heating systems.<br/><br/>
<strong>4. solid fuel systems:</strong><br/>
                -<strong>Wood or coal-fired boilers:</strong> Suitable for
                Rural areas, they provide autonomous heating. They can be
                connected to a radiator or underfloor heating system.<br/>
                -<strong>Stoves and fireplaces:</strong> In addition, they create a cozy
                atmosphere in the house and can be used as the main or
                additional source of heat.<br/><br/>
<strong>5. heat pumps:</strong><br/>
                -<strong>Air-to-air:</strong> They extract heat from the
                Outside air and transfer it to the house. Effective in
                temperate climates.<br/>
                -<strong>Air-to-Water:</strong> They extract heat from the outside air
                Outside air and transfer it to a water heating system,
                such as radiators or underfloor heating.<br/>
                -<strong>Land-Water:</strong> They extract heat from the ground via
                Using underground pipes and transfer it to the water heating system
                water heating. Most energy efficient, but requires
                significant initial investment.<br/><br/>
<strong>6 Hybrid systems:</strong><br/>
                -<strong>A combination of different sources:</strong> For example
                The use of a heat pump in combination with a gas boiler or an
                electric heater. This allows you to optimize energy consumption
                energy and ensure reliable heating in all conditions.<br/><br/>
<strong>Recommendations for selecting a heating system:</strong><br/>
                1.<strong>Take into account climatic conditions:</strong> The important thing is,
                to choose a system that will be efficient in your region.
                For cold winters, gas boilers or heat pumps are better suited
                ground-to-water.<br/>
                2.
                <strong>Consider the availability of energy resources:</strong> The choice of
                system depends on the availability of natural gas, energy
                electricity or other fuels in your area.<br/>
                3.<strong>Evaluate energy consumption and cost-effectiveness:</strong> Important
                is to take into account both the initial installation costs and the
                and the ongoing operating costs of the heating system.<br/>
                4.
                <strong>Consult with professionals:</strong> Contact
                Specialists to get a consultation and develop a
                heating system design, taking into account the specifics of your house
                frame house.<br/><br/>

                installation.

<p>
                Yes, at any distance from the factory there may be additional
                costs:<br/><br/>

                -<strong>Crane:</strong> The cost depends on the rates of local companies,
                calculated hourly or per shift (shift - 8 hours).<br/>
                -<strong>Plot with a slope:</strong> Additional rental
                construction scaffolding.<br/>
                -<strong>Seasonal installation:</strong> Fixed rate.

<summary>What kind of insulation material is used?</summary>
<p>
                We use IZOVAT insulation. The insulator does not contain resins
                phenol-formaldehyde resins. The insulation has no chemical odor,
                is produced on the basis of natural ingredients, safe for the
                environment and people, fireproof. It is recommended for use in
                all climatic zones.
              </p>

<div class="details">
<summary>Will the insulation move?</summary>
<p>
                This is impossible because of the design features and technology
                of laying the insulation. Since the skeleton of the building is assembled from
                45×195 wood, in the basic version we use 2
                layers of insulation of 100 mm each. The total thickness of the insulation
                is 200 mm. "Superfluous" 5 mm of insulation that extends beyond the frame,
                create additional friction between the insulation layers and the glass
                against the wind and compress the insulation, forcing it back
                through the grid into the windproofing layer. In the walls, we use
                insulation with a high density and stiffness of 45-50 kg/m³.
