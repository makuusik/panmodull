                <strong>Каркас of high quality.</strong> Our modular houses are
                built on a frame of planed, dried planks. The boards used are
                45x95, 45x145, 45x195 mm in size, with a 15-18% moisture
                content. For maximum strength, the following are used reinforced
                fasteners. The outer part of the framework is scaffolding, to

                The interior finish can include imitation logs, furniture grade
                plywood or gypsum board. Whole wood used for the framing is
                softwood, in this case pine. To ensure long durability and
                protection against harmful agents, the framework is impregnated
                with a preservative, an indelible antiseptic that protects the
                wood from mold, fungi, algae and insects for 35 years. Exterior
                visible elements, such as the veranda frame and wood trim, are

                Our experience shows that if the house has a small area (up to

                Insulating the walls with a thickness of 250 mm and the roof
                with a thickness of 300 mm provides very good thermal
                conductivity indices.

              <p>
                The floors, walls and ceilings in a PANMODUL house are insulated
                in the same way way "all around." Our design excludes air
                leakage at corners and connection points. Joints between modules
                are filled with board Izoplat 12 mm fiber-wood. The modules are
                then "solidly" connected to each other with screws through beams
                around the perimeter, from floor to ceiling.

                We use IZOVAT insulation. In the composition of the insulating
                material there are no phenol-formaldehyde resins. The insulation
                has no odor chemical, it is made on the basis of natural
                ingredients, safe for the environment and people, fireproof.
                Recommended for use in any climate zone.

              <summary>Will the insulation not shift?</summary>
              <p>
                This is impossible because of the design features and technology
                of laying insulation. Since the structure of the house is
                assembled from 45×195 wood, in the basic version we use 2 layers
                of insulation of 100 mm each. The total thickness of the
                insulation is 200 mm. "Excessive" 5 mm of insulation that
                extends beyond the frame, cause additional friction between the
                insulation layers and the weatherstripping film, and also
                "stretch" the insulation, pushing the it back through the frame
                and wind protection layer. In walls, we use insulation with a
                high density and stiffness of 45-50 kg/m³.

                The choice of glazing package depends not only on the number of
                chambers, but also on the thickness and additional layers that
                increase the energy efficiency. We use a glazing package
                double-chambered, consisting of three layers of glass. The total
                thickness of the glazing package is 44 mm, which is much higher
                than the standard budget options with a thickness of 32-36 mm.
                The inner and outer layer of glass is covered with a special
                coating energy-saving coating, which prevents heat loss and
                protects the room from overheating in the the room from
                overheating in the summer. Energy efficiency is determined by
                the heat transfer coefficient Ug = 1.00. In the glazing packages
                that we use in our large facades, Ug = 1.00, this is achieved
                thanks to the metallized coating, which reduces the absorption
                and transmission of thermal radiation through the glass and
                increases the reflectance of the glazing package in the range of
                wavelengths characteristic of thermal radiation thermal

                extends beyond the frame, create additional friction between the
                insulation layers and the glass against the wind and compress
                the insulation, forcing it back through the grid into the
                windproofing layer. In the walls, we use insulation with a high
                density and stiffness of 45-50 kg/m³.
