          <h2>Frame Houses – A Universal Solution for Modern Construction</h2>
          <p>
            Frame houses are gaining popularity due to their unique features and
            affordability. Modern technologies allow for the creation of designs
            that fully meet the requirements of comfort, energy efficiency, and
            durability. These houses are the perfect choice for those who value
            quality and savings.
          </p>

          <h2>Advantages of Frame Houses</h2>
          <p>
            One of the key advantages of a frame house is its energy efficiency.
            Thanks to high-quality insulation and thoughtful design, these
            houses have a low heat loss coefficient, which reduces heating
            costs. Additionally, the construction of a frame house is
            exceptionally fast – it can be built within a few months.
          </p>
          <p>
            Frame houses also offer great flexibility in design. They allow for
            the realization of any architectural concept – from small holiday
            homes to spacious family residences. The use of eco-friendly
            materials helps create a healthy indoor climate.
